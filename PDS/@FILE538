//***FILE 538 is from Jan Jaeger and contains IPL text to IPL ZZSA, *   FILE 538
//*           which is his standalone editor.  This file is         *   FILE 538
//*           oriented to Hercules users, but can be adapted to     *   FILE 538
//*           conventional MVS as well.                             *   FILE 538

//*       When run under Hercules on a PC, ZZSA is a tool to SEE    *   FILE 538
//*       MVS DASD and its contents, WITHOUT USING AN MVS SYSTEM!   *   FILE 538
//*                                                                 *   FILE 538

//*       If you are running Hercules already, you can use ZZSA     *   FILE 538
//*       immediately using a new member of this pds called         *   FILE 538
//*       ZZSAPACK.  ZZSAPACK is a zipped PC file which really      *   FILE 538
//*       is a Hercules, or PC/370 DASD minidisk.  You attach the   *   FILE 538
//*       ZZSA01 file to a Hercules configuration.  Then IPL it.    *   FILE 538
//*       You don't use MVS or z/OS, and you can see the contents   *   FILE 538
//*       of all the DASD in the configuration !!!  The ZZSA01      *   FILE 538
//*       pack is a mini-disk of ONLY ONE CYLINDER.  ZZSA is its    *   FILE 538

//*       This new member of this pds called ZZSAPACK was added     *   FILE 538
//*       by Sam Golob.  Download member ZZSAPACK, unzip it, and    *   FILE 538
//*       use it as a one-cylinder 3390 minidisk in a Hercules      *   FILE 538
//*       configuration.  IPL it, to run ZZSA and access all        *   FILE 538
//*       the MVS DASD in the configuration without IPL-ing         *   FILE 538
//*       another operating system.  Or you can attach the pack     *   FILE 538
//*       to a running Hercules configuration and IPL it.           *   FILE 538
//*                                                                 *   FILE 538
//*       Added members ZZSA80Z and ZZSA90Z which are newer         *   FILE 538
//*       versions of IPL-able ONE CYLINDER 3380 and 3390 packs,    *   FILE 538
//*       respectively, that will IPL ZZSA.  These contain this     *   FILE 538
//*       "help" information as dataset SYS1.ZZSA.HELP.  These      *   FILE 538
//*       two members are in zip format, but when you unzip them,   *   FILE 538
//*       they are usable in a Hercules configuration, and you      *   FILE 538
//*       can IPL ZZSA from them.  Remember that ZZSA80Z is a       *   FILE 538
//*       3380, and ZZSA90Z is a 3390.                              *   FILE 538
