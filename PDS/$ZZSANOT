Hi Sam,

I have been experimenting with the ipl from CDROM which is
currently available on G5+ and zseries machines.  I have made an
ipl-able version of my standalone editor, which can now be ipled
from cdrom.  It occurred to me the you are distributing the CBT
tape on CDROM these days, and I think it would be nice put the
iplable zzsa image on the cbt tape.  This way one does not need
to create a tape or copy on dasd.

One CD can contain more than one iplable program, so it is not so
that only 1 program can be ipled from.  The HMC prompts you with
a list of available programs that can be loaded (.ins files)
Anyway, this is just a thought, I have asked a few people to try
this out, please have a look at it yourself and let me know what
you think.

I have attached the following files:
zzsa.ins   <--- descriptor file
zzsa.img   <--- core image
zzsa.txt   <--- brief description on how to ipl from cdrom

The zzsa.ins and zzsa.img files must reside in the root directory
on the cdrom

Note:  I added a member which is an EBCDIC version of the
       zzsa.img file.  There is also the (folded FB-80)
       version of the ASCII zzsa.img file.  (Sam Golob)

Best regards,
Jan Jaeger.

Load from CDROM

In order to ipl from CDROM one must establish exclusive control
over the target machine, by means of selecting "Single Object
Operations" on the "CPC Recovery" tasklist.  Select the target
machine on which the image that you want to ipl exists.

This step can be skipped on Multiprise 3000 type machines, which
have an integrated HMC/Service Element.

The "CPC Recovery" tasklist now contains "Load from CDROM or
Server" select this task and the image you want to ipl.

Insert the CDROM containing the ZZSA (zzsa.ins and zzsa.img
files) code into the HMC, select bullet "Hardware management
Console CD-ROM" and press continue.

You can now select zzsa.ins as the software to load.  After
confirming the actions you can now use ZZSA from any locally
attached non-SNA 3270. (Just hit enter to get the logon screen)
